# image-blending

This project explored gradient-domain image processing, specifically focusing on Poisson blending, a technique with diverse applications such as blending, tone-mapping, and non-photorealistic rendering. The primary goal was to seamlessly integrate an object or texture from a source image into a target image, addressing the common issue of visible seams that occur when simply copying pixel values. Instead of directly pasting the pixel values, I aimed to find values for the pasted target pixels that maximally preserved the gradient of the source region while leaving the background pixels unchanged. This approach leverages the insight that our visual system is more sensitive to the gradient of an image than to its overall intensity, allowing for effective blending even if it alters the color intensity of the source object.
